# Known failures for NIST CCVS test suite

# Tests listed here are expected to fail and will not count as regressions.
# As compiler support improves, tests should be removed from these lists.

# Categories:
#   compile_fail  - Tests that fail during compilation
#   runtime_fail  - Tests that compile but produce wrong output or crash
#   skip          - Tests to skip entirely (e.g., require features not yet planned)
